Synthesize and place-and-Route a Network-on-Chip Router
Using automated design tools to synthesize Verilog RTL code and then perform physical design.

Network on chip or network on a chip (NoC or NOC) is a communication subsystem on an integrated circuit (commonly called a "chip"), typically between IP cores in a system on a chip (SoC). NoCs can span synchronous and asynchronous clock domains or use unclocked asynchronous logic. NoC technology applies networking theory and methods to on-chip communication and brings notable improvements over conventional bus and crossbar
interconnections. NoC improves the scalability of SoCs, and the power efficiency of complex SoCs compared to other designs.
